History of python:
------------------
Creator: Guido van Rossum
First Released: 1991
Purpose: Easy-toread, multi-task


Why Python:
------------------
Easy to learn and use
strong community and ecosystem
productivity and speed
Widely used (Multiplatform: web, mobile, game, AI, ...)


Difference between Library and framework:
------------------

The main difference between a library and a framework lies in control flow:

Library:
***********
1. You are in control: You decide when and how to call the functions or use the components of the library in your code.
2. A library is a collection of pre-written code (functions, classes, tools) that you can use to perform specific tasks.
3. Example: NumPy, Pandas in Python — you write your code and call these libraries when needed.

Framework:
***********
1. The framework is in control: It provides the main structure of the application and calls your code. You must follow its rules and architecture (known as "Inversion of Control").
2. Frameworks often provide templates, project structure, and design patterns you must follow.
3. Example: Django, Flask in Python — you define models, views, etc., according to the framework's rules, and the framework decides when to run your code.

Simple Summary:
***********
A library is like a tool you use.
A framework is like a house you build in — the structure is already there, and you must follow its layout. 

In machine learning, for example, Scikit-learn is more of a library, while TensorFlow or PyTorch are more like frameworks, as they provide the overall structure for building and training models.
